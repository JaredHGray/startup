## Things Learned from Simon
- A cloud server can only handle so much space taken up by images. It's smart to re-size and reduce resolution before uploading.
- New HTML commands learned: <hr />, <sup>, <th>
- Formatting is most likely going to change during creation as you have new ideas and introduce new CSS and JS code. That's good!
